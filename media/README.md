# Analysis Report

## Dataset: media.csv

## Insights
Based on the summary statistics, missing values report, and correlation analysis provided for the `media.csv` dataset, here are some insights and observations:

### General Overview
1. **Dataset Size**: The dataset contains 2,652 entries, with the date being the only column that has a few missing values (99 missing entries).
2. **Attributes**: The dataset includes information related to media content such as `date`, `language`, `type`, `title`, `by`, and ratings (`overall`, `quality`, `repeatability`).

### Language and Type Distribution
- **Languages**: The dataset has 11 unique languages, with English being the most common, which appears 1,306 times, indicating that it's the predominant language within the dataset.
- **Types of Media**: There are 8 different types, predominantly movies (2,211 occurrences), which suggests that the dataset is heavily focused on movie-related content.

### Ratings Analysis
- **Overall Ratings**: The mean overall rating is approximately 3.05, with a range from a minimum of 1 to a maximum of 5. The median (50th percentile) is also 3, suggesting that a significant portion of the entries is rated average.
- **Quality Ratings**: Quality ratings have a similar average of about 3.21 with a slight tendency towards better ratings as shown in the 75th percentile.
- **Repeatability Ratings**: The repeatability ratings average around 1.49, indicating that this may be a less significant rating compared to overall or quality ratings, with a maximum value of 3.

### Missing Values
- The title and type columns do not have missing entries, however, there is a significant number of missing entries for the `by` column (262), which may reflect incomplete information about the creators or contributors of the media.
- The missing values in `date` (99 entries) must be handled cautiously, especially if temporal analysis or trends across time are needed.

### Correlation Analysis
- **Overall and Quality Ratings**: There is a strong positive correlation (0.83) between overall and quality ratings, indicating that as one rating increases, the other tends to increase correspondingly.
- **Overall and Repeatability Ratings**: The correlation (0.51) between overall and repeatability ratings is moderate, suggesting some connection but also variability in how repeatability relates to general perceptions of media.
- **Quality and Repeatability Ratings**: The weaker correlation (0.31) indicates less linkage and suggests that quality ratings may be more influenced by factors other than repeatability.

### Clustering Insights
- The dataset seems to be organized into 3 clusters, with the largest cluster containing 1,315 entries, followed by 769 and 568 entries, respectively. The characteristics defining these clusters are not provided, but further analysis could reveal distinct groupings or segments in the dataset based on attributes such as ratings, types, and languages.

### Recommendations for Further Analysis
- **Handling Missing Data**: Strategies to handle the missing `by` entries may be necessary, such as imputation or exclusion, depending on the analysis goals.
- **Temporal Analysis**: If the dataset is intended for time-series analysis, addressing the missing date values is crucial. Exploring trends in ratings over time could provide valuable insights.
- **Comparative Analysis Across Languages and Types**: Performing comparative analyses across different languages and media types to see how ratings vary could yield interesting findings.
- **Cluster Profiling**: Investigating the characteristics and differences among the identified clusters would help in understanding patterns or preferences in media consumption.

These insights provide a foundational understanding of the `media.csv` dataset and suggest paths for deeper analysis and exploration.
